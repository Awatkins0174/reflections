What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?

    A hidden .git subfolder is created within the folder.  No commits are made
    originally.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?

    The staging area is an intermediate folder which holds the contents of a
    commit.  Files are added to it with a git add command.  In that way, not
    every file in the working folder is necessarily added to the repository. x

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical
change?

    Only place the files that express the single change into the staging area
    before commit.  Leave unrelated changes in the working directory and save
    for a future commit.

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history
organized?  How would branches help?

    When maintaining two or more distinct development paths, branching will keep
    track of each and version control the individual paths.

How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

    By charting the branches as a graph, you can see the individual paths of
    development for each branch.

What is the result of merging two branches together?  Why do we represent it in
the diagram as we do?

    All change are combined into one branch.
